# 3D Maze - aMazeBalls - Assignment 3-4

**Computer Graphics - Fall 2017**.

## Build and run

`gradle run`

1. Start off by importing the gradle project into your IDE.
1. Set the `Working directory` in your build/run configurations to the `core/assets/` folder.
1. Build & Run

## Controls

- `WASD` Movement.
- `← → ↑ ↓` Look around.
- `SHIFT` Move faster, this makes the evil snowman move faster as well.
- `Mouse` The mouse can also be used to look around.
- `V` God Mode, makes it possible to go through walls, fly around based on directional/looking vector and enables other buttons such as:
  - `R` Move down.
  - `F` Move up.

## Gameplay

The goal of the game is collect all the token/balls in the maze, when that is completed you levelup into a new larger maze.
Each maze is randomly generated.
Watch out for the evil snowman, if he gets you, you lose. (It's possible to pass him if you keep tight up to a wall).

## Known bugs

Due to some update lag it is eventually possible to get through walls if you're patient enough and keep colliding into them.

## Cool features that we spent time on

### Random maze generation

We found and used a [random maze generator](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Maze_generation#Java) from Rosetta code. The generator uses integer values to describe each cell where bitmask operations are used to grab the info. A cell with the value `12` or `1100` in binary `(NSEW)` has the North and South edge marked as open `1` but East and West as closed `0`.

### Wall collision

Each cell has border-limits on the X and Z axis in world space, the player is not allow to exceed these borders unless the cell is open in that direction. If the cell is open we also check if the player is within the perpendicular axis. This means that if a player tries to go south in a cell which is open to the south, he also has to be within the east-west borders of the cell.

### Texture effects

The walls have either a brick wall or wooden wall look, we spent a good time to randomly generate this look. The brick-wall consists of 72 boxes (bricks) + 1 solid wall box within.

### Snowman AI

The Evil snowman spawns randomly on a diagonal spot in the maze and travels to adjacent cells never looking back (turning around) unless hitting a dead end. At any cell if he has an option to not only move forward, his choice will be random.
When the player collides with the snowman he looses the game.

### Snowman looking at the player

We display the eyes and nose on the snowman based on the directional vector between the player and the snowman so that the snowman is always looking at the player.

### Mouse look-around

Being able to look around with the mouse without affecting the movement of the player inside the maze.

### Other

- 2D camera.
- Following the player in the 2D camera but also snapping the 2D view to the edges of the maze.
- Score indicator bar as you collect the tokens/balls.
- Fix Z-fighting object jitter, avoided by creating the pillars between all the walls. Makes for nice aesthetics too.

## Assignment 4 - Shaders and Lighting

1. Build a lighting model, implement the lighting calculations in the shaders and handle any variables needed to run them correctly.
1. Lighting model needs to include a material for what is being rendered and more than one light.
1. Full lighting model would have diffues, specular & ambient for every light + global ambience color.
  - + Diffuse, specular and ambient for the material being rendered.
  - + Position and direction for each light. Position for material comes from vertex geometry being sent through the shader.

### Choices

- How many lights
- Lightning calculations per vertex or per pixel/fragment.
  - Make sure you understand the difference and what information needs to flow between vertex and fragment shader in each case.
- Fixed directional, positions of lights (more flexibility can be cool but complex and unnecessary).
- Shaders are part of assignment 3, only return pdf report for assignment 4.

### The report

**2 Chapters**.

### Description of the lighting model

1. What's in it and why some things are included and other excluded.

### The entire code of our shaders

1. Describing what each line/part does.
  - Explain every variable and where and how it is used.
1. Make sure to describe the relationship between vertex and fragment shaders, even if most of the work is in one of them.
1. Get across the fact that we understand our shaders, within them and how that affects around them in OpenGL.

```c++
attribute vec3 a_position;
attribute vec3 a_normal;

uniform mat4 u_modelMatrix;
uniform mat4 u_viewMatrix;
uniform mat4 u_projectionMatrix;

uniform vec4 u_lightPosition;
uniform vec4 u_lightDiffuse;
uniform vec4 u_materialDiffuse;

//uniform vec4 u_color;
varying vec4 v_color;

void main()
{
    vec4 position = vec4(a_position.x, a_position.y, a_position.z, 1.0);
    position = u_modelMatrix * position;

    vec4 normal = vec4(a_normal.x, a_normal.y, a_normal.z, 0.0);
    normal = u_modelMatrix * normal;

    // --- Global coordinates ---

    // Lighting

    vec4 s = u_lightPosition - position; // Vector pointing to the light
    float lambert = dot(normal, s) / (length(normal) * length(s)); // How light hits the objects
    v_color = lambert * u_lightDiffuse * u_materialDiffuse;

    position = u_viewMatrix * position;
    //normal = u_viewMatrix * normal;

    // --- Eye coordinates ---

    //v_color = (max(0, (dot(normal, normalize(vec4(-position.x, -position.y, -position.z,0)) / length(normal)))) * u_color);
    //v_color = (dot(normal, vec4(0,0,1,0)) / length(normal)) * u_color;

    gl_Position = u_projectionMatrix * position;
}
```
