## Build and run
1. Start off by importing the gradle project into your IDE.
2. Set the `Working directory` in your build/run configurations to the `core/assets/` folder.
3. Build & Run

## Controls
- `WASD` Movement
- `← → ↑ ↓` Look around
- `SHIFT` Move faster, this makes the evil snowman move faster as well
- `Mouse` The mouse can also be used to look around

## Gameplay
The goal of the game is collect all the token/balls in the maze, when that is completed you levelup into a new larger maze.
Each maze is randomly generated.
Watch out for the evil snowman, if he gets you, you lose. (It's possible to pass him if you're tight up to a wall)

## Known bugs
It is possible to get through walls eventually if you wait due to update lag.
